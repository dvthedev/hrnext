## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to open issues or pull requests for any improvements or features you'd like to add.

### Guidelines

#### Commit Message Format

Each commit message consists of a header, a body and a footer. The header has a special format that includes a type, a scope and a subject:

https://www.conventionalcommits.org/

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

The **header** is mandatory and the **scope** of the header is optional.

Any line of the commit message cannot be longer 100 characters! This allows the message to be easier
to read on GitHub as well as in various git tools.

The footer should contain a [closing reference to an issue](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/) if any.

##### Types `<type>`

Must be one of the following:

- `build`: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
- `ci`: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `perf`: A code change that improves performance
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests

##### Scopes `<scope>`

The scope is like context. The following is the list of supported scopes (feel free to update any new scopes):

- `ui`
- `api`
- `db`
- `lib`
